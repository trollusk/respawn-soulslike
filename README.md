# Respawn Soulslike Edition #

When you die, drop your valuables and respawn in a safe location. Return and claim your belongings without dying again, or 
they will be gone for ever.

### What does it do? ###

When you die:
* you respawn in a "safe place", which can optionally be the nearest temple or hall of the dead, the nearest player home,
  the last used bed, or the last used campfire (see below)
* optionally, drop your gold or equipment in a "grave" where you died.
* optionally, non-boss enemies in the cell where you died are resurrected, healed and reset (just like Dark Souls)
* you get a quest to retrieve your belongings. The quest target is your grave.

To stop the player bypassing the gold loss mechanic by stashing gold in containers, there is an optional 
setting to prevent storage of gold. If this is active, you may not move gold from your inventory to any 
containers, corpses, or follower inventories. This means you will always be risking your gold when you enter 
dangerous situations.

If Campfire, Rest by Campfires, or Soulslike Bonfire Menu are installed, then interacting with campfires will move 
your "bed" respawn point to that campfire. In addition, if the campfire is outdoors then a marker will be placed on the map to
allow fast travel to the campfire.
